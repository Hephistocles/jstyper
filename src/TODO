Thoughts 

Next two stolen from http://gideon.smdng.nl/wp-content/uploads/thesis.pdf

Formal semantics are often defined separately from the actual implementation.
Whether or not a compiler or interpreter actually adheres to the defined
semantics is unclear and difficult to judge. Very few compilers or
interpreters have been proven correct with respect to the semantics.

â€¢ It has been argued that formal semantics might inhibit evolution of a
language; the maintenance costs of formal semantics could discourage
experimentation and extension
