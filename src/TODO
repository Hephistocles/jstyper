Test 21
Something about type stores merging after e.g. an if/else (Test 8?)
aliased mutation not handled - e.g.  `var y = {}; x=y; y.foo=0;` x should have a foo property at the end but doesn't

# Questions for Kathy

Mutation: In the example code:
	
	var x = {};
	x.foo = 3;
	
Do both occurences of 'x' have the same type (viz {foo:number})? Like the 'real' type of x is {foo:number}, and on line 1 it is given an incomplete initialisation. This is easy but not type-safe (reading x.foo before foo is initialised would give 'number' in our system, but in reality the type is 'undefined'). 

Conclusion, clearly they should have different types. How?..
