A full implementation might want to wrap up typed world so that content literally can't be touched

Remember to assiciate type variables with all expressions, not just variables

inferring ts where dynamic exists but never generates any constraints
prove safety for this
then prove that any runtime error must have been caused by a mimic or guard

Maybe don't waste too much time cleaning up

Over the break: weekly stat reports (Tuesday), but can have conversations whenever necessary. 28th - 31st may be fairly disconnected so maybe no skype then!
Send code tomorrow!
