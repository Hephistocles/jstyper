\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

The aim of the project is to produce a type system for a subset of
JavaScript which can be statically analysed, along with a gradual-typing
framework extending this subset to include standard JavaScript programs
which are too dynamic to evaluate statically. This subset should include
the basic JavaScript primitives, as well as object literals and simple
functions including most assignment, comparison and arithmetic
operators. There is a large scope for extensions supporting more of the
language. Evaluation will take the form of a type soundness proof for
the system, and a quantitative analysis of the performance of the
compiled JavaScript.

\section{Starting Point}\label{starting-point}

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  confident javascript programmer
\item
  builds on Part IB courses in Compiler Construction and Semantics
\item
  Read some papers
\item
  Will be using \href{https://www.npmjs.org/package/acorn}{Acorn} to
  parse JavaScript and produce AST.
\end{itemize}

\section{Resources}\label{resources}

For this project I will mainly use my own machines - either a desktop
(Ubuntu 14.04, 3.6GHz i7, 8GB RAM, 2x 1TB HDD) or laptop (Windows 8.1,
1.8GHz i7, 8GB RAM, 1TB HDD) as convenient. I will use Git for version
control, with remotes set up on Github and on a VPS hosted by BHost for
backup purposes. I require no additional special resources.

\section{Work to be done}\label{work-to-be-done}

The project can be broken into the following sub-projects:

\begin{enumerate}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Definition of a formal type system along with the subset of JavaScript
  which is supported\\*Problem - what format should the definition of
  supported JavaScript take, such that I can prove safety for it?
\end{enumerate}

\begin{itemize}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Should have following properties:\\ Progress: Given arbitrary gamma, e
  and T, gamma\textbar{}-e:T=\textgreater{}e is a value or some e'
  exists which e can reduce to\\ Preservation: Given arbitrary gamma, e,
  e' and T, (gamma\textbar{}-e:T and e-\textgreater{}*e')
  =\textgreater{} gamma\textbar{}-e':T\\ Decidability of checking: Given
  arbitrary gamma, e and T; gamma\textbar{}-e:T is decidable\\ Type
  inference: Given arbitrary gamma and e; can find T such that
  gamma\textbar{}-e:T or show no such T exists
\end{itemize}

\begin{enumerate}
\itemsep1pt\parskip0pt\parsep0pt
\item
  Create a static type checker for the above type system (which will
  clearly need to include type inference)
\item
  Create a source-to-source compiler to implement gradual typing,
  allowing code which has had its type checked by the above to safely
  interface with unchecked code.
\end{enumerate}
