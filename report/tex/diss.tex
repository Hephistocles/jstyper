	\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}
		\subsection{Why is type-checking interesting?}
		\subsection{What's interesting about JavaScript?}
		\subsection{Others' approaches to type-checking JavaScript}
	\section{Preparation}\label{preparation}
		\subsection{Foundations of typing (background reading) --- Milner, Pierce}
		\subsection{Separation of tasks --- splitting language features and development phases}
		\subsection{Selection of dev tools (why JavaScript, which AST generator)}
	\section{Implementation}\label{implementation}

		For each of these sections, I will discuss a few relevant/interesting
		cases. Some of the problems may have had implications in several
		phases of the the implementation, so I'll have to decide where to talk
		about those. 

	
		\subsection{Formal Definition of Type System}
		\subsection{Constraint Generation}
		\subsection{Constraint solving}
		\subsection{Gradual typing}
		Some problems to discuss: \\
			Object Property addition \\
			Recursive `this' \\
			Solving constraints iteratively (rather than in one pass at the end) \\
			Solving substructure constraints (several times\ldots) \\
			distinction between `dynamic' and `import' \\
	\section{Evaluation}\label{evaluation}
		\subsection{Proof of Safety}
		\subsection{`Sanity Check': visual inspection of my test cases}
		\subsection{Correctness tests comparing output of code with and without gradual typing}
		\subsection{Speed Overhead}
		\subsection{Memory overhead}
	\section{Conclusions}
		\subsection{Things still to do for maximum usefulness}
			Arrays, Prototypal Inheritance, Strings as objects, functions as objects \\
			Auto-detect imported vars by scope analysis \\
			Fine-grained object modification by control flow analysis
